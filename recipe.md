Recipe:

Chop the onions in long strands and the green chillies in very fine pieces.

Heat mustard oil in a nonstick pan. Add the finely chopped green chillies.

After some time, add onions and salt according to taste and keep stirring until golden brown.

Then add schezwan sauce and mix well. Stir properly.Keep that aside in a plate.

Now, cook maggi as per the general recipe and make sure you get it properly dry and maybe a little burnt on the lower side to get some smoky fragrance….

After it gets properly cooked,serve it in a dish….spread some schezwan chutney and then mix the prepared onion well. 

Enjoy it.
